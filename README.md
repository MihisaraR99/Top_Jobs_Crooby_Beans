Mobile Application Development (IT2010 Module)
<h3 align="center">Introduction To Project</h3>


In the modern world everyone is undergoing busier lives than ever. People do not have time to read newspapers and random websites to search for job opportunities. To overcome this problem, we created “JobSeeker”. This is a free job vacancy app which is mainly designed to help IT job seekers who sleep and dream of Python, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Blockchain, AR/VR and data science to find the latest local and international job openings in their field. Also, the companies that offer jobs can find employees with required qualifications using “JobSeeker”.
Users can simply register for the app and can find their dream jobs in all career levels, part time jobs and internships in an easy and convenient way through this app whether you are a fresh graduate or an experienced professional. It can be used to keep an eye on the employment market even once you have found an employment. It will keep you up to date with the changing job market and never let you miss your next best career.  If you are searching for a job the home page of the app will help you to find a job. If you find the job you need you can contact the company and apply for the job by a simple touch of a button. 
Do not close the app if you did not find the required opportunity, you can post a job request. You can market yourself by adding your educational qualifications, experience in the field and other qualifications to the job request. You can attract the world's best companies in the IT field anytime anywhere. While you are scrolling through the job vacancies, finding one and planning to apply for it later you can save it for future reference and apply when you are free. It is specifically designed to minimize misplacing your job advertisements.   
If a company is seeking for an individual with the necessary skills to hire, they can post a job advertisement to find a suitable candidate from the millions of qualified job seekers all over the world. We do not mind if you are a brand-new startup or a company that has a history of more than 10 years, the app is open for everyone.
